# WebSocket 


**WebSocket Request**

`WSS <account-group>/api/pro/stream`


In order to authorize the session you must include `<account-group>` in the URL. Without `<account-group>`, you can 
only subscribe to public data. 

**Code Sample** 

Please refer to python code for all kinds of [websocket operation]{https://github.com/bitmax-exchange/bitmax-pro-api-demo/blob/master/python/client.py} (e.g. authorization, sub/unsub, place/cancel order, and so on)
